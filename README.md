# Development Branch


## How to contribute


> I have seperated the project into 2 branches - main and development
- Main - the branch where only I will commit, to keep it absolutely stable.
- Development - the branch where you are to make PRs, which I will review and merge your pull requests.


Ensure that you work on your respective folder to keep things consistent, There are 2 folders, one is 'components' and other is 'Pages', the component folder has the smaller components like buttons, cards, etc along with their CSS files whereas the Page folder contains the page with all components bundled together.  

- Keep in mind that we all are here to learn, so do the work honestly.
- If you get stuck, do not hesitate to ask.
- Ensure that you work on your respective folders
